# Welcome
This repository contains my personal Home Assistant configuration. 

## Hardware
My entire Home Assistant setup runs on a Intel NUC Kit DC3217IYE with Ubuntu Server 18.04.
I'm also using a P1 USB cable for my electricity meter, the Aeotec Gen 5 Z-Wave Plus USB controller for my Z-Wave devices and a Texas Instruments CC2531 for ZigBee.

# Say Hi
Please feel free to contact to me if you have any further questions about my setup and/or configuration.
